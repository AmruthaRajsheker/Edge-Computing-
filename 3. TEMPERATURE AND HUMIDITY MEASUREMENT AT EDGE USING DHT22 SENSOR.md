### **THEORY**

**Edge computing** refers to processing data locally at the device or sensor level before forwarding it to the cloud. The **DHT22** sensor is commonly used in edge deployments due to its low power consumption, digital output, and high precision.

#### **DHT22 Sensor Specifications:**

* **Temperature Range**: -40°C to +80°C (±0.5°C accuracy)
* **Humidity Range**: 0% to 100% RH (±2–5% RH accuracy)
* **Interface**: Single-wire digital communication
* **Update Rate**: 0.5 Hz (one reading every 2 seconds)
* **Power Supply**: 3.3V or 5V compatible

#### **Raspberry Pi Pico Interface:**

* The Pico operates on **3.3V logic**.
* The **MicroPython DHT driver** enables communication over one GPIO pin using the DHT protocol.
* Data is read in digital form, eliminating the need for analog-to-digital conversion.

| **DHT22 Pin** | **Connection**                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| VCC           | 3.3V (from Raspberry Pi Pico)                             |
| DATA          | GP15 (can be any GPIO)                                    |
| GND           | GND (Pico Ground)                                         |
| Pull-up       | 10kΩ between VCC and DATA (optional for signal stability) |

> *Ensure the sensor is connected with correct polarity to avoid damage.*

### **WORKING PRINCIPLE**

1. **Initialization**: The DHT22 sensor is connected to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi Pico with a pull-up resistor to ensure signal stability.

2. **Triggering**: The Pico sends a start signal; the DHT22 responds with a 40-bit digital data stream representing temperature and humidity.

3. **Data Reading**: The `dht` MicroPython library reads and decodes the signal into temperature (°C) and humidity (%).

4. **Display & Loop**: The values are printed every 2 seconds, enabling real-time environmental monitoring.

---

### **MICROPYTHON PROGRAM**

> Before running, install the DHT driver in Thonny (`dht.py` module), or use built-in libraries if available.

```python
import machine
import time
import dht

dht_pin = machine.Pin(1,machine.Pin.IN,machine.Pin.PULL_UP)
sensor = dht.DHT22(dht_pin)

while True:
    try:
        sensor.measure()
        temp = sensor.temperature()
        hum = sensor.humidity()
        print(f"Temperature: {temp:.1f}")
        print(f"Humidity: {hum:.1f}")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error reading sensor:", e)

    time.sleep(2)  
```

### **OUTPUT OBSERVATIONS**

| **Timestamp** | **Temperature (°C)** | **Humidity (%RH)** | **Remarks**               |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 10:01:00 AM   | 26.55                | 42.30              | Normal ambient conditions |
| 10:01:05 AM   | 26.58                | 42.40              | Slight fluctuation        |
| 10:01:10 AM   | 26.50                | 42.20              | Reading stabilized        |

> Data can optionally be logged to a file or transmitted over serial/Wi-Fi for cloud integration.
