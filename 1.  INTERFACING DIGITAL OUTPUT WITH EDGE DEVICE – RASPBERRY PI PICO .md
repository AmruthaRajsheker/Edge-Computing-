### **THEORY**

The **Raspberry Pi Pico** is a low-cost, high-performance microcontroller board built on the **RP2040** dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor. It features:

* **40-pin I/O layout** with **26 multifunctional GPIO pins** (GP0–GP28).
* On-chip support for **PWM**, **digital I/O**, **analog input (ADC)**, and communication protocols like **I2C**, **SPI**, and **UART**.
* A **BOOTSEL** button for firmware flashing via USB and **SWD** pins for debugging.

The board operates at **3.3V logic level** and supports both **MicroPython** and **C/C++** programming. Its compact form factor and rich I/O capabilities make it suitable for real-time edge computing applications in IoT, automation, and robotics.

---

### **WORKING PRINCIPLE**

1. Digital output control is performed by setting a **GPIO pin** to a **HIGH** state (3.3V) to **turn the LED ON** and a **LOW** state (0V) to **turn it OFF**.
2. The GPIO pin’s logic level is manipulated using MicroPython’s `Pin` class.
3. A **330Ω resistor** is used in series with the LED to limit current and prevent damage.

### **PROGRAMS (MicroPython)**

#### **1. Basic LED Blinking**

```python
from machine import Pin
from utime import sleep

print("Pi Pico Initialized")

led = Pin(0, Pin.OUT)

while True:
    led.toggle()
    sleep(0.5)
```

#### **2. Sequential LED Blinking**

```python
from machine import Pin
from utime import sleep

led1 = Pin(0, Pin.OUT)
led2 = Pin(3, Pin.OUT)
led3 = Pin(9, Pin.OUT)

while True:
    led1.toggle()
    sleep(0.5)
    led2.toggle()
    sleep(0.5)
    led3.toggle()
    sleep(2)
```

#### **3. Sequential LED Blinking with Buzzer**

```python
from machine import Pin
from utime import sleep

led1 = Pin(0, Pin.OUT)
led2 = Pin(3, Pin.OUT)
led3 = Pin(9, Pin.OUT)
buzzer = Pin(15, Pin.OUT)  # Assumed buzzer is on a separate GPIO pin

while True:
    led1.toggle()
    sleep(0.5)
    led2.toggle()
    sleep(0.5)
    led3.toggle()
    buzzer.toggle()
    sleep(2)
```

### **OBSERVATIONS**

| **Program**             | **Observed Behavior**                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic LED Blinking      | LED toggles ON and OFF every 0.5 seconds             |
| Sequential LED Blinking | LEDs turn ON sequentially with delay between toggles |
| With Buzzer             | LEDs blink sequentially; buzzer toggles with LED3    |
