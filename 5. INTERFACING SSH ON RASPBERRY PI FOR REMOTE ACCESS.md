## **EXPERIMENT NO. 05 – INTERFACING SSH ON RASPBERRY PI FOR REMOTE ACCESS**

---

### **AIM**

To enable and establish a secure SSH (Secure Shell) connection with the Raspberry Pi, allowing remote terminal access for configuration and control.

### **THEORY**

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol that enables secure data communication and remote command-line access. By enabling SSH on the Raspberry Pi, users can remotely configure, control, and manage the device without requiring a monitor or keyboard (headless setup).

There are several methods to enable SSH:
* Via Raspberry Pi Configuration Tool
* Using raspi-config on the terminal
* Creating a blank “ssh” file in the boot partition (headless setup)

SSH operates on **port 22** and requires the **IP address** of the Raspberry Pi for establishing the connection. It is widely used for remote administration and deployment in IoT and embedded systems projects.

### **PROCEDURE**

#### **Step 1: Enabling SSH on Raspberry Pi**

* **Method A – GUI Mode**

  * Navigate to: *Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration*
  * Go to the **Interfaces** tab
  * Enable **SSH** and click **OK**

* **Method B – Terminal Mode**

  * Open Terminal
  * Execute: `sudo raspi-config`
  * Navigate: *Interfacing Options > SSH > Enable*
  * Reboot if prompted

* **Method C – Headless Mode**

  * Insert microSD card into a PC
  * In the **boot partition**, create an empty file named `ssh` (no extension)
  * Insert the card into Raspberry Pi and power on

---

#### **Step 2: Find the Raspberry Pi IP Address**

* On Terminal: `hostname -I`
* Or: Access your router’s admin panel to view connected devices

---

#### **Step 3: Connect via SSH**

* **On Windows (Using PuTTY):**

  * Open PuTTY
  * Enter IP address in **Host Name**
  * Set **Port** to 22 and connection type to **SSH**
  * Click **Open**
  * Login credentials:

    * **Username**: `pi`
    * **Password**: `raspberry` (default)

* **On Linux/macOS Terminal:**

  * Command: `ssh pi@<IP_ADDRESS>`
  * Accept the fingerprint (first-time only)
  * Enter password when prompted

### **RESULT**

SSH was successfully enabled and configured on the Raspberry Pi. A secure terminal session was established using PuTTY (on Windows) and Terminal (on Linux/macOS), enabling remote control of the Raspberry Pi for headless operations and remote project development.
